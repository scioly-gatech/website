    <span className='font-bold font-lg'>Spectator and Photography Policy</span> <br />

    Spectators will be allowed for the Bridge, Scrambler, Trajectory, and Flight events. Spectators must remain in designated spectator zones. To protect and assure the privacy of competitors’, event supervisors’ and volunteers’ information, photography will only be permitted to head coaches and other members of the same team with wristbands to respect the privacy of other team builds. Any violation of this prohibition may violate the SOINC Student, Coach, and Parent Pledges, and SOINC Media Recommendations.
    <br /><br />
    Volunteers and event supervisors reserve the right to ask any spectator to leave the premises of the event for any reason. Event supervisors may penalize the spectator’s affiliated team for unsportsmanlike behavior at their discretion.

    <span className="font-bold font-lg"> Wristband Policy </span> 
    <br />
    During check-in, coaches will receive one wristband for the head coach and 15 wristbands for their students. Wristbands are required for all students competing in events. Trial events will not require wristbands. Impound will not require wristbands. Students will be required to be wearing a wristband in order to compete; we will not be providing extra wristbands if they are lost. </p>
